# Welcome to Rhombus Systems
Rhombus Systems was built on a foundation of API-driven micro-services. As a result, a deep and comprehensive set of API endpoints exist and are made available to our customers. 
These API contracts are not an afterthought, but are actually used by internal Rhombus software.
This means that anything that the system is capable of doing can also be done via the Rhombus API.

This Repository is home to Python based examples for many of the endpoints of Rhombus Systems' API, examples for other common languages can be found [here.](https://github.com/RhombusSystems)
